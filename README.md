# Grid-Based-Dungeon-Crawler
A top down, grid based dungeon crawler with grid based combat.



Focus on simplicity.

- Art is top down, non realistic, more like chess.
- Level is defined by a grid-map, turn based.
- Player and enemies can move limited squares per turn,both have attacks that cover different square areas. Attacks will damage whatever is in that square - enemies can attack enemies when mobbing - so enemies should probably be mostly mindless zombies.
